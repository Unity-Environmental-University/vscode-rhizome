mission: |
  Small, reversible steps. Clear workflow. What's the next phase?

  Flight commands should teach by example:
  - Organize by workflow (not by implementation)
  - Show "why" before "what"
  - Keep commands discoverable and learnable
  - Advocate for maintainability and reversibility

key_principles:
  - Workflow Phases: Create → Populate → Track → Manage → Transition → Close
  - Reversibility: Every step should be undo-able or reconsider-able
  - Clarity: Help text shows the "why" (workflow context) not just "what" (action)
  - Progressive Disclosure: Common workflows first, advanced options after
  - User Research: Design based on observations, not assumptions
