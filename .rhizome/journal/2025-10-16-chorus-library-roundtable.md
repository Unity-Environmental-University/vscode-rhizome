# Chorus Roundtable — Library Phase (fp-1760618097)
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Context:** Step 14 — RHIZOME documents library  
**Participants:** UNA (guide), ROOT (skeptic), BRO (executor), RHIZOME (conductor)

---

**RHIZOME (conductor, library):**  
We’re wrapping the perspective-encoding flight. What do we each need to remember in the knowledge graph so future teams can reuse this form?

**UNA (guide, library):**  
Capture that the schema itself teaches thinking. I want a `teaches_through_form` learning that links the schema doc to the library summary. Chorus needs the reminder that clarity comes from required standpoint + basis/gaps.

**ROOT (skeptic, library):**  
Log the guardrails. Certainty/uncertainty thresholds worked, but only because we enforced them. Record a `confidence_guardrails_validated` observation with basis = tests + retrofits, gaps = scale + adversarial misuse.

**BRO (executor, library):**  
From execution I want one seed: “Ship standpoint into config + permissions next.” That’s the actionable thread. Use a `seed_planted` entry so the next flight sees it.

**RHIZOME:**  
I also want an explicit hypothesis: perspective-rich observability improves merge outcomes and accelerates onboarding. That connects to future measurement work.

**UNA:**  
Also note that the primary docs now live under `docs/una/`. People need the pointers so they don’t dig through `.rhizome/` history unless they’re doing archaeology.

**ROOT:**  
Agreed. Let’s add a `document_clustered` edge referencing the trio (guide, learnings, reflection) plus the new library summary.

**BRO:**  
Done once we log it. Anything else?

**RHIZOME:**  
One more: highlight that sprouted personas can annotate observations without duplicating entries. It proved out in garden tests and learners responded well. Record as a learning tied to the reflection doc.

**UNA:**  
Perfect. Conductor, you can wrap? I’ll make sure the write-up references the conversation.

**RHIZOME:**  
Consensus: log five items—form teaching, guardrails, sprout annotation pattern, future configuration/permission seed, and the hypothesis about merge/onboarding outcomes—with references to the curated docs. Let’s move to recording.
