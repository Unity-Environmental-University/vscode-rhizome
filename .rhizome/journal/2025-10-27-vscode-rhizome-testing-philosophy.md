# Journal Entry: vscode-rhizome Testing Philosophy & Don-Socratic Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Contributor**: Claude Code (Session 2)
**Project**: vscode-rhizome Extension + Rhizome Integration
**Context**: Completed comprehensive testing suite and documented don-socratic philosophy for knowledge transfer

---

## What Happened

Implemented and documented comprehensive testing strategy for vscode-rhizome extension using:
1. **Rhizome flight planning** to sketch two test scenarios
2. **Don-socratic questioning** to extract test patterns into a reusable library
3. **Test library design** with 4 classes and 23 tests
4. **Knowledge transfer** to rhizome/.rhizome/ for future developers

## The Question That Started Everything

> "When you write tests for multiple features, what do they all need? Setup, teardown, mocking, assertions, configuration... Why would you repeat this code across every test? What if you extracted it? What would you call it?"

**Answer emerged through questions, not instruction.**

---

## Four Core Patterns Extracted into Test Library

### 1. TestWorkspace
**Problem**: Tests need isolated, temporary directories with guaranteed cleanup
**Solution**: Class that manages lifecycle (setup, createFile, readFile, teardown)
**Why it matters**: Cleanup is error-prone. Encapsulation makes correct usage easiest.

### 2. MockRhizome
**Problem**: Tests call external tools (rhizome CLI), which is slow and fragile
**Solution**: Mock that simulates responses, records calls, enables deterministic testing
**Why it matters**: I/O dependencies are slow. Pure I/O belongs in helpers, not tests.

### 3. TestAssertions
**Problem**: Tests use low-level assertions that don't document intent
**Solution**: Semantic methods (fileContains, configHasValue, gitignoreContains)
**Why it matters**: Names document what's being tested, not how to test it.

### 4. TestSetup
**Problem**: Setup code is repetitive and procedural
**Solution**: Factory methods (createStubGenerationTest, createWithOpenAIKey)
**Why it matters**: Setup is scaffolding. Factories let readers focus on what's interesting.

## Test Organization: Three Categories Per Feature

**Happy Path** (4 tests for stub generation)
- "What happens when everything works?"
- Find marker → Parse → Generate → Insert
- Success flows, no edge cases

**Error Paths** (5 tests for stub generation)
- "What happens when something breaks? How does it fail gracefully?"
- No marker → Complex types → Multiline signatures
- Each failure is explicit, documented, handled

**Integration** (1 test for stub generation)
- "Do all the pieces work together?"
- Full workflow end-to-end
- Catches failures at seams

**Total**: 23 tests across 2 features with consistent structure

---

## Don-Socratic as Design Principle

### How Don-Socratic Guided Architecture

**Question**: "When you call external services, what should be encapsulated?"
**Answer**: Pure I/O in helpers, orchestration in commands
**Result**: Commands are 1-4 lines, helpers are focused

**Question**: "Those repetitive appendLine() calls... what pattern do you see?"
**Answer**: Header-divider-content-footer structure
**Result**: Extracted formatPersonaOutput() helper
**Teaching Moment**: Left visible pattern so readers discover it

**Question**: "Both don-socratic and inline-question need the same validation. What if you extracted it?"
**Answer**: getActiveSelection() helper prevents duplication
**Result**: Both commands reuse same selection validation

### How Don-Socratic Guided Testing

**Question**: "How should tests be organized?"
**Option A**: By implementation (testFindStubComments, testGenerateStub)
**Option B**: By user experience (Happy Path, Error Paths, Integration)
**Answer**: Option B mirrors how users think about features
**Result**: Tests grouped by workflow, not function

### How Don-Socratic Guided Documentation

Comments ask questions instead of giving answers:

```typescript
/**
 * don-socratic asks:
 * When you call out to an external service, what should
 * you encapsulate? What belongs in a helper, what stays in the handler?
 */
async function queryPersona(...) { ... }
```

Readers think before reading code. That's learning.

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### Decision: AST vs Regex for Signature Parsing

**Options**:
- Regex: Fast, 90% coverage, silent failures
- AST: Slower, 100% coverage, requires @babel/parser

**Initial**: Try AST, fall back to regex
**Feedback**: "Or we could just require it"
**Final**: Make AST default, regex fallback for Python

**Why**: Robustness by default, not optional. Cost is visible.

### Decision: Encapsulate Repetitive Code or Leave Visible?

**Options**:
- Extract: Hide the pattern, cleaner code
- Leave visible: Show the pattern, readers discover it

**Initial approach**: Extract helpers
**User feedback**: "THAT makes me itch to fix it" (leave visible)
**Final**: Leave 8 repetitive appendLine() calls visible
**Why**: Friction as a teacher. Readers discover pattern naturally.

### Decision: Extract Test Library or Keep Tests Simple?

**Options**:
- Keep in each test: No dependencies, but repetitive
- Extract library: DRY, but adds abstraction

**Process**: Asked don-socratic "What patterns repeat?"
**Result**: 4 classes extracted (TestWorkspace, MockRhizome, TestAssertions, TestSetup)
**Benefit**: 23 tests with NO setup boilerplate. Tests focus on interesting parts.

## What This Enables For Rhizome

### For Future Developers
- Clear examples of reusable test patterns
- Reference implementation of don-socratic principles
- Documented philosophy for design decisions
- Working code to study

### For Rhizome Itself
- Model for testing extension-like projects
- Template for test library extraction
- Philosophy for embedding questions in code
- Pattern for knowledge transfer between Claude instances

### For The Don's Voice
- vscode-rhizome demonstrates don-socratic in action
- Rough edges as questions (not TODOs)
- Code that teaches by example
- Tests organized by user thinking

---

## Numbers & Scope

**Code**:
- 5 helper functions extracted in extension.ts
- 4 test utility classes (test-utils.ts)
- 23 comprehensive tests (extension.test.ts)
- 3 new commands (init, donSocratic, inlineQuestion)

**Documentation**:
- TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md (9.4 KB)
- DON_SOCRATIC_IN_PRACTICE.md (11 KB)
- TESTING_AND_DONQUESTION_REFERENCE.md (15 KB)
- TESTING_GUIDE.md (2,000 words)
- TEST_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md (1,500 words)
- Total: 35+ KB, 5,500+ words

**Knowledge Transfer**:
- All findings copied to rhizome/.rhizome/
- 3 reference documents for future developers
- Working implementation in vscode-rhizome
- Everything discoverable and actionable

## Lessons Learned

### Testing
1. **Extract patterns, not functions** - TestWorkspace exists because cleanup is hard, not because workspace creation is complex
2. **Test organization mirrors user thinking** - Happy/Error/Integration is how users think, not how code is structured
3. **Semantic assertions teach** - fileContains() documents what's being tested better than low-level assertions
4. **Factories beat procedures** - Declarative setup lets readers focus on what's interesting

### Don-Socratic
1. **Questions are more powerful than answers** - They invite thinking instead of compliance
2. **Rough edges teach if left visible** - The repetition is the lesson
3. **Comments explain WHY, not WHAT** - "Why does this exist?" is more valuable than "What does this do?"
4. **Code teaches by friction** - Constraints and visible patterns are better teachers than instruction

### Architecture
1. **Extract when error-prone** - Cleanup, state management, side effects
2. **Extract when repeated** - Same pattern across multiple places
3. **Extract when semantic** - Has a name and purpose, not just mechanism
4. **Leave some visible** - Let readers discover patterns themselves

- Apply don-socratic philosophy to rhizome codebase
- Consider similar knowledge transfer for other projects

### For Future Work
- When testing: Consult TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md
- When designing: Consult DON_SOCRATIC_IN_PRACTICE.md
- When struggling: Refer to vscode-rhizome examples
- When teaching: Use this philosophy as template

## Critical Insights for Claude Continuity

### The Testing Library Pattern
When multiple tests need the same things:
1. Identify the pattern (workspace, mocking, assertions, setup)
2. Extract into classes with clear purposes
3. Document WHY each class exists (don's question)
4. Use in tests to eliminate boilerplate
5. Result: Tests focus on what's interesting, library handles mechanics

### The Don-Socratic Pattern
When writing code that teaches:
1. Embed questions in comments (not instructions)
2. Leave some patterns visible (readers discover)
3. Organize by user thinking (not implementation)
4. Name functions by purpose (what should they do?)
5. Result: Code teaches by example, friction, discovery

### The Knowledge Transfer Pattern
When finishing work:
1. Document what you learned
2. Copy findings to discoverable location
3. Provide references to working code
4. Make guidance actionable
5. Result: Future instances inherit wisdom, not start from scratch
