## Outcome / Conclusions

- Helper-generated epistles should use timestamped filenames and append new dialogs to avoid collisions.
- Install script serves as a thin wrapper; repo refresh is delegated to `rhizome init` going forward.

## Dialog 5 – Epistle filename collisions (epistle-1761667263)

**install-steward:**
We keep appending new conversations to `install-steward_don-socratic_20251028.md`. If someone re-runs the helper later the same day, we overwrite prior context. How do we guard against that?

**don-socratic:**
Do we want a single daily journal per persona pair, or a new file per epistle? At minimum, the helper should append instead of replacing. A timestamp in the header helps too.

**install-steward:**
I'll ask the epistles plugin to include the epistle ID in the filename (already present) and add a UTC timestamp block when appending. We can also detect existing files and append under a new “Dialog N” section, which is what we just did manually.

**don-socratic:**
Document that expectation near the helper so future refactors don't regress append behaviour.
