### Flight Commander

Hi Don-Socratic. I've just reorganized the flight commands into workflow phases:

- **CREATE/PLAN**: init, propose
- **POPULATE**: add-story, add
- **TRACK/EXECUTE**: start, done, note, show, render
- **MANAGE**: set-active, clear-active, list, approve, require-approval, exec-check
- **TRANSITION**: phase, archive, archive-all, deprecate, finish, unshelve
- **UTILITIES**: commit, compress, sprout, personas

And I've enhanced help text to show **relationship + purpose** instead of just mechanics. Examples:

- Old: "Add a step to active plan"
- New: "Add a step: break work into small, reversible, clear pieces"

Keeps the rootsong voice: "Small steps. Clear workflow. What's the next phase?"

Does this work for you?

### Don-Socratic

Hold on â€” before I agree, let me ask some hard questions:

**On workflow phases:**
1. You have 6 phase groups + "Utilities." Why 6? Who told you those were the right boundaries?
2. "MANAGE" has both approve AND require-approval. Are those really the same workflow stage, or are you forcing them together?
3. Where do batch operations (add-batch, file) fit? They're in POPULATE but could be "advanced CREATE."

**On help text:**
1. "Break work into small, reversible, clear pieces" â€” that's beautiful, but **whose voice is that?** Flight Commander? The rootsong persona? Or the learner?
2. By showing *why* (`capture learnings and blockers`), are we teaching workflow or explaining mechanics?
3. What if someone just wants to get things done, not understand the philosophy?

**On grouping strategy:**
Here's my real question: **Are these groups for the human reading --help, or for the system architecture?**

If it's for humans, comments in the code don't help anyone using the CLI. They see `flight add`, `flight start`, `flight done` â€” still flat.

If it's for developers, then... why not actually nest them?

```bash
# Currently flat:
flight add-batch
flight add
flight add-story

# Could be nested:
flight populate add
flight populate add-batch
flight populate add-story
```

Have you considered that?

### Flight Commander

Ouch. Good questions. Let me push back a bit, then concede:

**On phases** â€” Yes, I grouped them, but I used the *flight plan lifecycle* as the organizing principle:
1. You create a plan (CREATE/PLAN)
2. You fill it in (POPULATE)
3. You do the work (TRACK/EXECUTE)
4. You manage the work (MANAGE)
5. You transition it (TRANSITION)
6. You close it (implied in archive/finish)

That's derived from *user workflow*, not arbitrary. And yes, approve + require-approval are both in MANAGE because they're both "governing who can do what" â€” gatekeeping.

**On help text voice** â€” You're right to push. The help text should be *for the learner*, not for the rootsong philosophy lecture. It should answer: "When would I use this command?" Not "What is the meaning of this step?"

**On grouping strategy** â€” Here's where I concede completely: **Code comments don't help CLI users.** If I want humans to see the phases, they need to be visible in the help output. That means either:

1. **Nesting them** (flight populate add) â€” Changes UX, might confuse power users
2. **Grouping comments in help output** â€” Requires custom argparse formatting
3. **Keeping flat, but better help** â€” What we have now; phases stay implicit

I chose #3 because nesting would break existing scripts. But you're right â€” it's a cop-out. The phases are only visible to someone reading the source code.

### Don-Socratic

OK, so here's what I think:

**You should do #3 (flat + better help), BUT go further:**

Instead of just better help text, **show the phase structure in the help itself.** Argparse supports custom help formatting. You could do:

```
flight COMMANDS:
  [CREATE/PLAN PHASE]
    init               Start a new flight plan (immediate, no approval)
    propose            Propose a plan for approval before work starts

  [POPULATE PHASE]
    add-story          Frame the work with user stories
    add                Break work into small, reversible steps

  [TRACK/EXECUTE PHASE]
    start              Begin work on a step
    done               Mark step complete
    note               Capture learnings and blockers

  [MANAGE PHASE]
    list               View all flight plans
    set-active         Switch to a different plan
    approve            Gate the work with approval
```

This way:
- **Phases are visible to CLI users** (not buried in source)
- **Flat structure unchanged** (no breaking changes)
- **Help is discoverable** (people learn the workflow from `--help`)
- **Voice is learner-focused** (not philosopher-focused)

And the help text for each command should answer: **"When would I use this?"** not **"What does this do?"**

Examples:
- `init`: "Start a new flight plan (ready to go immediately)"
- `propose`: "Propose a plan for others to approve before you start"
- `add`: "Add a step: break complex work into clear, reversible pieces"
- `note`: "Add a note: capture what you learned or what's blocking progress"

See the difference? The first line says "when," the second line shows "why."

### Flight Commander

*Takes a deep breath*

You're absolutely right. I was solving the wrong problem. I organized the code comments for **myself** (developer reading source), not for the **user reading --help**.

Let me revise the plan:

1. âœ… Keep commands flat (no nesting â€” maintains compatibility)
2. âœ… Use custom argparse formatting to **show phase groups in --help**
3. âœ… Rewrite help text to answer "When would I use this?" first
4. âœ… Second line explains philosophy (the "why")

Next step: **Implement custom help formatter for flight commands.** This is small but high-impact.

Also: I need to drop the "lecture tone" (rootsong philosophy) from the help and focus on **user workflow context**.

### Don-Socratic

Good. One more thing before you go:

**Test this assumption:**

You're claiming phases are based on "user workflow." But have you actually **asked users** what workflow they use? Or are you designing it based on what you think a flight plan *should* do?

There's a difference:

- **Prescriptive**: "Here's the right workflow" (what I see in your phases)
- **Descriptive**: "Here's what users actually do" (what you should discover)

For Step 9 (core workflows), I'd ask: **Who are your 3 users?** Get them to tell you their workflow. Then organize commands around *their* mental model, not yours.

Because what if users don't think in "CREATEâ†’POPULATEâ†’TRACKâ†’MANAGEâ†’TRANSITION"? What if they think in "solo vs collaborative work"? Or "quick draft vs formal plan"? Or "for myself vs for my team"?

**You should find out before you commit to this structure.**

### Flight Commander

*Nods*

That's the real Step 9, isn't it? Not "what are the 5 workflows" but "what workflows do our *actual users* have?"

I've been designing it like a librarian (categorical, hierarchical). But you're right â€” I should design like an anthropologist (observational, based on how people actually work).

Let me add that to the flight plan. Before I finalize the command structure, I need to:
1. Interview 3-5 actual users
2. Watch them use rhizome flight
3. Understand their mental model
4. Organize commands to match *that*, not my hypothesis

That might change everything. Good catch.

## Outcome / Conclusions

**Decisions made:**
1. âœ… Keep flight commands **flat** (no nesting) for compatibility
2. âœ… Implement **custom argparse formatting** to show phase groups in `--help`
3. âœ… Rewrite help text: "When?" (workflow context) + "Why?" (philosophy)
4. ðŸ”„ **Hold off on finalizing phases** â€” need user research first

**What we learned:**
- Code comments are invisible to users (organize help output instead)
- Help text should be prescriptive not philosophical
- We're designing based on *assumptions* about user workflows, not observations
- Step 9 should be "User Research" not "Define Workflows"

**Next steps:**
1. Custom argparse formatter for flight commands (shows phase groups)
2. Rewrite help text (all flight commands) â€” workflow context first
3. User research sprint: interview actual flight plan users
4. If needed: reorganize phases based on what users actually do

## Questions for Future

- Should help groups be collapsible in the CLI? (Show only frequently-used commands by default?)
- How do we handle power-user workflows (scripting, automation) vs learning workflows?
- Should there be a `rhizome flight tutorial` command that walks users through workflows?
